                            Inspired by the surreal charm of Matt Furie, Jin has emerged with the arrival of the Year of
                            the Snake — coiling Chinese tradition with modern meme culture. After years of hibernation
                            in his hidden temple, Jin awakened upon hearing whispers of Matt Furie’s new book. Now, as
                            the crypto world enters a new cycle, Jin has already begun to stamp his mark on the world.
                            He brings with him luck, games, and gold — but only to those who dare follow his path
